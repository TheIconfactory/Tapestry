[Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/about/) is an online service for monitoring regularly running tasks such as cron jobs.

It uses the dead man's switch technique: the monitored system must "check in" at regular, configurable time intervals. When this doesnâ€™t happen, an item will appear in your timeline.

You will need a `Project API Key`, which can be found in account settings as "API key (read-only)". The `Check Identifier` is the UUID at the end of the check-in URL.
