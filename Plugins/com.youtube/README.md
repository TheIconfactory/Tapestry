The YouTube connector lets you keep an eye on your favorite channels: whenever a new video is posted, you'll see it in your feed.

Use the "Include Video Description" setting to turn off descriptions on channels that are long and not descriptive.

The easiest way to add a channel is with the [Feed Finder](tapestry://feedfinder) â€” when you enter a value like `youtube.com/@iJustine`, the feed will be set up automatically.
