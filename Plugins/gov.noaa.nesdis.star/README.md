The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates [two weather satellites](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/) over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

This connector loads the latest imagery from either satellite and updates it in your timeline every two hours. Youâ€™ll be able to see weather conditions, oncoming hurricanes, and the occasional solar eclipse.
