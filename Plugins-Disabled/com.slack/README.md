This connector lets you view a Slack channel in Tapestry.

You will need API keys to access your Slack workspace: they can be created on the [developer API site](https://api.slack.com/apps/). Get started with the "Create New App" button, then use the "From scratch" option.

Once you have the app created on Slackâ€™s site, the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" values can be used when setting up the feed in Tapestry.
